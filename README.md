# Genomics Pipeline Intro

Introduction to basic genomics filetypes and processing techniques. The methods presented are necessary for moving from raw genomic reads to variants, but additional steps not introduced here should be implemented. In other words, the purpose of this introduction is to help individuals new to genomics understand the basics of file transformation; it is not to present every step in genomic data processing.

## .FASTQ 
Similar to .fasta files, .fastq files contain a <b>[sequence identifier](#fastq-seq-id)</b> and biological <b>[sequence data](#fastq-seq-data)</b>. Additionally, .fastq files contain a sequencing <b>[quality score](#fastq-qual-score)</b> for each base pair position. Here is an example of one sequence and its associated information:

```
@SeqID
AAGCCAGCAAACCTTGTTTTACCTCACTGATATAGATTAGATATTTCAAGACAAATTTGTTGCCAATGTTAGATTATTAACATTATTTATTATAAAAATA
+
CCCFFFFFHHHHHJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJIJJJJJJJJJJJJIJIJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJIJJJJJJIJJJJHHHHHHHFFFFFFFEEEEEEC
```

# <a name="fastq-seq-id"></a>
#### 1) .fastq Sequence Identifier
The first line is the sequence identifier. The first character for the identifier line is '@'. Similar to the '>' character in .fasta files, the '@' character in .fastq files denotes the sequence identity for the following sequence. Additionally, this line might contain a description of the sequence. 
 
# <a name="fastq-seq-data"></a>
#### 2) .fastq Sequence Data
The second line contains the sequence itself (string of nucleotides). The sequence is followed by a '+' on the third line to indicate the end of the sequence string.

# <a name="fastq-qual-score"></a>
#### 3) .fastq Quality Score
The fourth line contains a quality score for each position of the sequence. Each character represents a number based on ASCII coding (see this [link](https://support.illumina.com/help/BaseSpace_OLH_009008/Content/Source/Informatics/BS/QualityScoreEncoding_swBS.htm) for the relationship between symbols and quality score value). On this scale, 0 ('!') is the lowest value, and 40 ('I') is the highest value. Because each score corresponds to a site within the sequence itself, the number of score symbols must equal the number of positions in the sequence.

#### Looking at a .fastq file
Let's look at an example .fastq file. Sometimes these files can be very large, but example.fastq is an abbreviated file that can be opened in your text editor. If on the command line, you can examine this file using ```vim example.fastq```. 

> note: If you are new to using vim, you can exit without saving by typing ':q!' followed by enter. 

You'll notice that the sequence identifier line is more complex than the example above. Sequencing companies use this line to provide unique characteristics of each sequence. For example, Illumina paired-end sequencing (the platform and method used to obtain this sequencing data) uses a [specific format](https://help.basespace.illumina.com/articles/descriptive/fastq-files/) for the sequence ID and description.

With this info, you can parse out the information from the first sequence id in example.fastq as follows:

| Order |  description     | value      |
|:-----:|:----------------:|:----------:|
|  1    |  instrument      | D3NH4HQ1   |
|  2    |  run number      | 149        |
|  3    |  flowcell ID     | C1H5KACXX  |
|  4    |  lane            | 3          |
|  5    |  tile            | 1101       |
|  6    |  x-pos           | 2106       |
|  7    |  y-pos           | 2242       |
|  -    |  space           | -          |
|  8    |  read            | 2          |
|  9    |  is filtered     | N          |
|  10   |  control number  | 0          |
|  11   |  index number    | GCTCGGTA   |

For the purposes of this introduction, you don't need to worry about all of these elementsâ€“ just that this line is the unique identifier for the sequence with additional sequencing details.

## .SAM
Sequence alignment map (SAM) files are text-based genomic files with biological sequence data aligned to a reference sequence. SAM files contain a <b>[header section](sam-header-section)</b> and an <b>[alignment section](sam-alignment-section)</b>. They contain the same information as the .fastq file, with additional information on mapping details. As you probably gathered, that makes these files larger than the .fastq files. Here is an example of header and alignment lines within a .sam file:

```
@SQ SN:NC_045541.1  LN:186725308
@PG ID:bwa PN:bwa CL:bwa mem -t 4 -M RefGenome.fasta Read1.fastq Read2.fastq
SeqID 99  ref_name 72165682    60  100M    =   72165982    399 TACTTATGTTCTTCTTCATTCAGGATCATATGTGAAACTTCAGAAAAGCTAATATGTGAAACTTCAGAAGACAAATATGGTGAGAACAACAGTGAAAGAG    CCCFFFFFHHHHHJIJJJJJJJIJIJJJJJIJJJJJJJJJJIIJGIJJJJJJJIJJBGIJJJIJIIJJIJJJIIICFIHEA@EGHHHHHFFFEFEEEEDE
```

# <a name="sam-header-section"></a>
#### 1) .sam Header Section
The header section precedes the alignment section, and each heading begins with the '@' symbol. Each heading contains tab-delimited sections. The first column indicates the record type. The following columns contain tags and values (in the format TAG:VALUE). While there are different tag types, two you will see often are @SQ (reference sequences) and @PG (programs used for creating .sam). The values of these tags contain information about the sequence. @SQ requires the reference sequence name (SN) and length (LN) tags, and the @PG tag requires the program identity but may also include the program name (PN), version (VN), and command line implementation (CL).


# <a name="sam-alignment-section"></a>
#### 2) .sam Alignment Section
The alignment section requires 11 tab-separated fields, and additional fields are optional. Each line within this section represents the alignment of a segment to the reference. The 11 required sections include information on the query template (read that mapped), the reference sequence name (SN), the position on reference where the query template mapped, the mapping quality, the sequence itself, and the quality score for each position in the base pair. Simplified descriptions of each required field are within the table in the [looking at a .SAM file](sam-example) section.


# <a name="sam-example"></a>
#### Looking at a .sam file
Let's look at an example .sam file. These files can be very large, but example.sam is an abbreviated file that can be opened in your text editor. If on the command line, you can examine this file using ```vim example.sam```. 
> note: If you are new to using vim, you can remove text wrap by typing ':set nowrap' followed by enter. You can see line numbers by typing ':set number' followed by enter. You can exit vim without saving by typing ':q!' followed by enter. 

You'll see that there are many @SQ header lines (one for each of the reference sequences). Each of these has a name and length. At line 366 you'll see the @PG header line for the program details. The remaining lines of the file contain alignment information. From what we learned above, we can parse the first alignment line (line 367) as follows:


| Col |  Field     | Type   |  Description                                                                  |  Value             |

### .VCF
Variant call format (VCF) files are text-based genomic files with information on sequence variation. More specifically, it includes sites where multiple characters are present in the samples examined. A .vcf file contains a <b>[header section](vcf-header-section)</b> and a <b>[variant data section](vcf-data-section)</b>. Basic .vcf files do not contain information on every position from the .fastq or reference file, rather they include information on the genomic positions with sequence variation. As you probably gathered, that makes these files smaller than the .fastq and .sam files (and the less variation, the smaller the file). Here is an abbreviated example of header and alignment lines within a .vcf file:

##### abbreviated .vcf file

```

# <a name="vcf-header-section"></a>
#### 1) .vcf Header Section
The header section precedes the variant data section, and each heading begins with '##' symbols (notice there are *two* hash marks).  Information about the variant dataset, the reference sequence, and the program used to generate the .vcf are contained within the header. 
The ```FORMAT``` header lines define tags whose properties pertain to the variant site as a whole, whereas the ```INFO``` header lines describe tags whose properties pertain to the genotype for each individual in the dataset. The abbreviations in ```FORMAT``` and ```INFO``` header lines correspond with those in the data section. The abbreviated .vcf file example above defines four ```FORMAT``` tags (GT, AD, DP, and GQ) and four ```INFO``` (AC, AF, DP, and FS) tags.  The ```contig``` and ```reference``` sections contain information about the reference used for variant calling.

# <a name="vcf-data-section"></a>
#### 1) .vcf Variant Data Section
The variant section consists of a row for every variant. The columns provide information about (1) site-level properties and annotations and (2) sample-leve annotations. The first section of columns (site-level properties and annotations) correspond to the variant site as a whole. This section consists of 8 columns, all of which are required in the vcf file (```CHROM```, ```POS```, ```ID```, ```REF```, ```ALT```, ```QUAL```, ```FILTER```, ```INFO```). These required fields include information about the location, the reference allele, the alternate allele(s), and the quality of the SNP. While these fields are required for each variant, they can be empty (a signified by ```.```). Descriptions for each of these fields are shown in the table below (values are from the variant of the abbreviated vcf file above).

| Col |  Field  |  Description                                                                   |  Value        |
|:---:|:-------:|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:-------------:|
|  1  | ```CHROM```  |  Contig name                                                                   |  NC_045541.1  |
|  2  | ```POS```    |  Position of variant within contig                                             |  1206         |
|  3  | ```ID```     |  Optional identifier for variant                                               |  .            |
|  4  | ```REF```    |  Reference allele (sequence character(s) at POS in reference)                  |  A            | 
|  5  | ```ALT```    |  Alternate allele (sequence character in at POS in at least one sample)        |  G            |
|  6  | ```QUAL```   |  Phred-scaled probability that variant exists at this site given data*         |  138.21       |
|  7  | ```FILTER``` |  ```PASS``` means the variant has passed filtering, . means no filtering has occurred|  .      |
|  8  | ```INFO```   |  Site-level annotations (properties of variant site as a whole)                |  AC=2;AF=0.25;DP=6;FS=0.000 |

###### \* Value of 10 means 0.1 chance of error; value of 100 means 0.0000000001 chance of error

The ```INFO``` values correspond to the flags defined in the header, where descriptions are provided. In the abbreviated vcf file, we see that this variant as an allele count (```AC```) of 2 (there are two alleles at this site), a minor allele frequency (```AF```) of 0.4 (the alternate allele's frequency in the dataset), a depth of coverate (```DP```) of 6 (the average depth per-individual at this site is 6 reads), and a p-value (```FS```) of 0.000. There are typically more property fields than this in a vcf, but this hopefully gives you a sense of how to read these sections.

The subsequent columns pertain to sample-level annotations. These fields consist of the formatting for the sample-specific property (```FORMAT```) followed by a column for each sample. In the abbreviated vcf file above, there are three samples (```Sample01```, ```Sample02```, and ```Sample03```). The values within the sample columns correspond to the ordered flags shown in the ```FORMAT``` column. These properties are shown in table format below; the Col values are a continuation from the table above.

| Col |  Field          |  Description                            | Value           |
|:---:|:---------------:|:---------------------------------------:|:---------------:|
|  9  |  ```FORMAT```   | Format for sample-specific annotations  | GT:AD:DP:GQ     |
|  10 |  ```Sample01``` | The annotation values for Sample 01     | 0/0:6,0:6:42    |
|  11 |  ```Sample02``` | The annotation values for Sample 02     | ./.:0,0:0:0     |
|  12 |  ```Sample03``` | The annotation values for Sample 03     | 1/0:5,7:12:71   |

The value column can be somewhat challenging to understand, so we'll break it down:

| Flag | Description                  | ```Sample01``` | ```Sample02``` | ```Sample03``` |
|:----:|:----------------------------:|:--------------:|:--------------:|:--------------:|
| GT   | Genotype\*                   | 0/0            | ./.            | 1/0            |
| AD   | Allele depth\*\*             | 6,0            | 0,0            | 5,7            |
| DP   | Total depth at variant site  | 6              | 0              | 12             | 
| GQ   | Genotype quality\*\*\*       | 42             | 0              | 71             |

###### \* Depth for ref , depth for alt
###### \*\* 0/0 = homozygous for ref allele; 1/1 = homozygous for alt allele; 1/0 = heterozygous; ./. no data
###### \*\*\* Value of 10 means 0.1 chance of error; value of 100 means 0.0000000001 chance of error

## Exercise
The basic workflow and data for this exercise come from [Farkas et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2021.665041) and the associated [github repository](https://github.com/cfarkas/SARS-CoV-2-freebayes).

### Exercise Objective
Download and analyze a small sample of genomic data using published scripts to see an applied process of genomic data processing.

For this exercise, create a text file called \<last-name\>_exercise3.txt. Within this text file, you should answer each of the questions in this exercise marked with an asterisk (*).

### Getting set up
1.  Make sure [mini/anaconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) and python versions = 2.7 and >=3.0 are installed.
2.  Clone repository and activate conda environment
```
git clone git@github.com:rklabacka/genomics-pipeline-intro.git # clone repository using password-protected ssh key
cd genomics-pipeline-intro
conda config --add channels conda-forge                        # add conda-forge channel (if you haven't already done so)
conda config --add channels bioconda                           # add bioconda channel (if you haven't already done so)
conda env update --file environment.yml                        # install required programs
conda activate genomics-pipeline-intro                         # activate genomics-pipeline-intro enviroment
bash makefile.sh                                               # make & install
sudo cp ./bin/* /usr/local/bin/                                # Copy binaries into /usr/local/bin/ (require sudo privileges)
```

3.  Install a vcftools version that includes the --haploid flag as follows:
```
git clone https://github.com/cfarkas/vcftools.git       # Forked Julien Y. Dutheil version: https://github.com/jydu/vcftools
cd vcftools
./autogen.sh
./configure
make                                                    # make
sudo make install                                       # requires sudo privileges
```

4. Install the latest version of sra toolkit. See instructions here:
```
https://github.com/ncbi/sra-tools/wiki/02.-Installing-SRA-Toolkit
```

### Raw reads to vcf

Examine the genomics-pipeline-intro.sh (in the bash_scripts directory). Where are the areas where file transformation occurs? What input files are necessary?

You can see the parameters required for the script by looking at the help menu:
```
genomics-pipeline-intro -h
```

Now that you have examined the script, run it.

```
genomics-pipeline-intro -l July_28_2020_NorAm.txt -g covid19-refseq.fasta -a 0.4999 -t 4
```
